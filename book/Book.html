                    <h1>Things to know about manga.</h1>
                    <p>Reading manga can be a unique and enjoyable experience.
                        Direction of Reading: Unlike English-language books, manga is read from right to left. This means you start reading a manga volume from what traditional English-language readers would consider the back of the book. The right to left directional rule also applies to reading the panels inside.
                        Top to Bottom: As with English-language comics, manga reads from top to bottom but this works in conjunction with the right to left rule.
                        Genres: Manga covers a wide range of genres, so you can expect to find stories that suit your personal taste.
                        Remember, it might take a little time to get used to reading manga. But once you get the hang of it, youâ€™ll find a whole new world of storytelling waiting for you. Enjoy your reading!</p>
